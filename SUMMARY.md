**Cows2021 Dataset** is a dataset for object detection and identification tasks. It is used in the livestock industry. 

The dataset consists of 42422 images with 13178 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cattle torso*).

Images in the Cows2021 dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 32020 (75% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 5 splits in the dataset: *identification-train* (23350 images), *identification-test* (8670 images), *detection_and_localisation-train* (7248 images), *detection_and_localisation-test* (2131 images), and *detection_and_localisation-val* (1023 images). Additionally, images in *identification-test* and *identification-train* splits contain information about ***cow_id***. The dataset was released in 2021 by the University of Bristol.
